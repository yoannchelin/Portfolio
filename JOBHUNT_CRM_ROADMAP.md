# Second project suggestion: JobHunt CRM (MERN)

Goal: a personal applicant tracker built for high‑volume job hunting.

## MVP (fast + impressive)
- Auth (JWT)
- CRUD Applications: company, role, link, location, salary range, status, notes
- Pipeline board: Applied → Phone screen → Interview → Offer → Rejected
- Reminders / follow‑ups (date + message templates)
- Dashboard: applications/week + conversion rate
- Export CSV

## "Signals" that recruiters like
- Clean API (pagination, filters)
- Validation + error handling
- Basic tests + GitHub Actions CI
- Docker (dev)
- Deployment: Vercel (web) + Render (API) + MongoDB Atlas

When you’re ready, tell me:
1) preferred cities / remote
2) your exact statuses to track
3) any extra fields (visa, recruiter name, salary)
